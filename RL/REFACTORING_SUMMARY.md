## 🚀 Now Actionable

### Before Refactoring
The original document was a **high-level plan** suitable for:
- Stakeholder communication
- Conceptual understanding
- Initial feasibility assessment

### After Refactoring
The new documentation set is an **executable playbook** that provides:
- ✅ Concrete numbers (dataset sizes, timelines, costs)
- ✅ Step-by-step procedures
- ✅ Copy-paste hyperparameter configs
- ✅ Implementation blueprints (simulator, tools)
- ✅ Quality gates and rollback procedures
- ✅ Checklists to ensure nothing is missed

**Someone can now take these documents and implement the RL pipeline without guessing.**
