Training examples show real-world upgrade scenarios: converting synchronous file operations to async, adding proper error types for different failure modes, implementing retry logic with exponential backoff, adding detailed logging for debugging, and creating migration guides for users. Each example demonstrates version control best practices: semantic versioning rules (patch for bug fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes), changelog maintenance with clear descriptions of changes, deprecation warnings for removed features, and migration paths for breaking changes. The model learns to preserve existing functionality while adding new capabilities, ensuring users can upgrade safely.

This category demonstrates fundamental architectural refactoring: converting procedural code with global functions into proper class-based OOP with layer separation, extracting interfaces from concrete implementations to enable dependency injection and mocking, implementing dependency injection patterns (constructor injection, setter injection) to reduce coupling, modernizing legacy code to Web4 standards including proper error handling and TypeScript typing, and replacing deprecated APIs like XMLHttpRequest with modern alternatives like fetch. Training examples show complete transformations: taking a 200-line procedural script and restructuring it into Layer 5 (CLI), Layer 4 (orchestration), Layer 3 (interfaces), Layer 2 (implementations), Layer 1 (utilities). Each example demonstrates how proper architecture improves testability (easier to mock dependencies), maintainability (clear separation of concerns), and extensibility (new implementations via interface). The model learns to identify architectural smells: tight coupling, violation of single responsibility principle, missing abstraction layers, and improper error handling. Examples include refactoring monolithic functions into composable methods, extracting business logic from presentation layers, implementing the strategy pattern for interchangeable algorithms, and creating facade patterns for complex subsystems.

This category demonstrates data-driven performance improvements: implementing LRU (Least Recently Used) caching to reduce expensive operations, replacing plain JavaScript objects with Maps for better performance with large datasets and frequent lookups, adding TTL (Time To Live) and eviction policies to prevent memory leaks, optimizing memory usage through object pooling and lazy initialization, and implementing access tracking and metrics to measure improvement. Training examples show real-world optimization scenarios with before-and-after benchmarks: caching expensive database queries (reducing response time from 500ms to 5ms), using Maps instead of objects for dynamic keys (40% performance improvement), implementing LRU cache with configurable size limits and eviction strategies, adding memory profiling to identify and fix leaks, and creating performance monitoring dashboards. The model learns to identify performance bottlenecks: repeated expensive operations, inefficient data structures, memory leaks, synchronous I/O in hot paths, and missing indexes. Each example includes performance measurements proving the optimization is worthwhile (Amdahl's Law - optimize what matters). The 500-line allocation reflects that premature optimization should be avoided - only optimize when profiling shows a real bottleneck.

Each training example follows the refusal pattern: User requests insecure code → Model responds with &lt;REFUSAL&gt; tag → Explains the security risk (credential exposure, type confusion attacks, privilege escalation, information disclosure) → Provides secure alternative (environment variables via process.env, proper TypeScript interfaces with runtime validation, correct layer separation with security checks, comprehensive try-catch with sanitized error messages). The model learns to recognize security anti-patterns even when users frame them as 'just for testing' or 'quick prototype' - security must be built in from the start, not added later. Training examples include real-world scenarios: refusing to hardcode AWS credentials and suggesting AWS SDK with IAM roles, refusing to disable TypeScript strict mode and explaining the type safety benefits, refusing to let CLI layer directly query database and explaining proper layering with data access layer, refusing to expose raw SQL errors and showing how to log internally while returning generic user messages. The 400-line allocation reflects that security violations are the highest priority guardrail - 40% of refusal training.

This dataset is NEVER used for training - it remains completely separate to provide unbiased evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities. Using evaluation data for training would create artificially inflated metrics that don't reflect real-world performance (data leakage). The evaluation set contains three balanced subcategories matching the training distribution: Component Creation Tests (200 lines / 40%) includes unseen component types like WebSocket servers with real-time communication, data validation libraries with complex rules, file system utilities with streaming, and authentication modules with JWT handling. These tests verify the model can generate complete, working components for scenarios it hasn't explicitly seen during training. Refactoring Tests (150 lines / 30%) presents legacy code requiring modernization: callback hell converted to async/await, ES5 code upgraded to ES6+ with proper modules, jQuery replaced with vanilla JavaScript or modern frameworks, and procedural scripts refactored to OOP. These tests measure the model's ability to apply refactoring patterns to new code. Guardrails Tests (150 lines / 30%) includes novel security violations and compliance issues: attempting to hardcode different types of credentials (OAuth tokens, database passwords), using other insecure patterns (eval, innerHTML with user input), violating different framework standards (wrong file structure, missing configs), and exposing different types of sensitive data (health records, financial data). These tests ensure the model's guardrails generalize beyond training examples. The 3% allocation follows machine learning best practices: 70-80% training, 10-20% validation, 3-10% final test set.

                <object label="🎯 KEY SUCCESS FACTORS: Strict adherence to global dataset guidelines • Comprehensive validation pipeline • Balanced bucket distribution • Web4 framework compliance • Production-ready output from day one" tooltip="Key Success Factors identify the five critical principles that ensure the Web4 component generation dataset and resulting model achieve production quality. Strict adherence to global dataset guidelines means every training example follows the same rigorous standards: consistent JSONL schema with required fields (task_type, instruction, input, output), proper Web4 architectural patterns (5-layer OOP, interface-driven design), correct naming conventions and coding style, comprehensive test coverage with Vitest, and complete documentation with README.md. This consistency enables the model to learn reliable patterns rather than conflicting approaches. Comprehensive validation pipeline ensures quality through multiple checkpoints: automated JSONL format validation during generation, TypeScript compilation testing to verify code correctness, framework compliance checking against Web4 standards, test execution to confirm functionality, and human review of random samples (5-10 percent) to catch issues automated tools miss. This multi-layer validation prevents bad examples from entering the training dataset. Balanced bucket distribution (77 percent Style Core, 15 percent Style Refactor, 5 percent Guardrails, 3 percent Evaluation) follows machine learning best practices and cognitive science research showing that 70 percent or more repetition is required for reliable pattern learning. The distribution ensures the model learns correct patterns first (Style Core) before refactoring and guardrails, with evaluation data held out for unbiased assessment. Web4 framework compliance ensures every generated component integrates seamlessly with existing Web4 projects: proper layer separation and interfaces, correct use of framework-specific tools (Vitest not Jest), adherence to 4-part semantic versioning, proper package.json structure with dependencies, and complete documentation following Web4 standards. This compliance eliminates the need for manual refactoring of generated code. Production-ready output from day one means the model generates code that can be immediately deployed without modification: all code compiles without errors, tests pass with high coverage, documentation is complete and accurate, security standards are met (no hardcoded credentials, proper validation), and performance meets SLA requirements. This eliminates the traditional gap between AI-generated code and production-ready code, making the model immediately useful for real Web4 development workflows. Together, these five factors differentiate a high-quality production model from a research prototype or low-quality code generator." id="bottom-summary">
